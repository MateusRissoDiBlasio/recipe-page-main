## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challange was really good to learn how annoying responsive layouts can be, I've encountered solutions for some issues with (LI) List Itens markers positioning difficulties inside (OL) Ordered Lists and (UL) Unordered Lists, that I'd never imagined were that hard, all about display inline-block, I didn't use a custom marker, what made me learn about it, and find another way to solve it.

I'm learning a lot on this challenges that puts you on situations that you need to think, and try all possibilities, and use what suit you're need. This journey has only began for me, and I'm proud on my accomplishments.

### Continued development

I'm getting comfortable with HTML + CSS, but I'm only on basics, want to learn even more each day, so that I can learn some useful java frameworks, and try to learn a lot about handling database.
